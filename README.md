Saff, for the love of God, stop twisting what I am. Just because I told you that being around Soap isnâ€™t a good idea doesnâ€™t mean I, or anyone ELSE is manipulative. Thatâ€™s not what this is about, and you know it. Youâ€™re seriously starting to act just like Soap, and itâ€™s honestly ridiculous. Iâ€™ve tried again and again to show you that I care, to be there for you, to make things work. But instead of listening to me or anyone else whoâ€™s actually trying to help, youâ€™ve decided to follow Soapâ€™s feelings like theyâ€™re gospel. Itâ€™s like our voices donâ€™t matter to you anymore.

And I swear, if I get even one more complaint from you guys, Iâ€™m going to crash out. Iâ€™m not saying that lightly. It wonâ€™t just be me losing it, itâ€™ll be Russel and NPC too. Weâ€™re all at our breaking point, and you keep pushing like none of it matters.

Also, Soap, stop bringing up my past. Iâ€™ve already admitted I was wrong. Iâ€™ve taken the blame. Iâ€™ve owned up to everything, even things I didnâ€™t need to. Iâ€™ve literally blamed myself just to keep the peace. What more do you want from me? You keep dragging it up like itâ€™s some kind of weapon, and Iâ€™m done with it. Iâ€™m not perfect, but Iâ€™ve tried. Iâ€™ve tried harder than you even realize.

ALSO. for crying out LOUD. adding Vinny to literally fucking everything. Like Jesus Christ on a stick, we are not conjoint twins or something. When I say my shit, donâ€™t bring him into it. Iâ€™m allowed to speak for myself without you dragging him into every damn sentence like weâ€™re a package deal. Itâ€™s exhausting. And Saff, Vinny SHOWED PROOF of how Soap is manipulative, and obviously you canâ€™t see that. Stop throwing the manipulative card at literally anyone and anything just because you donâ€™t like whatâ€™s being said. Itâ€™s getting out of hand.

Iâ€™m done being the only one trying to hold this mess together while everyone else keeps tearing it down.
